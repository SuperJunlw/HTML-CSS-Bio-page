                <p class="text">Jun Wu was born in Guangdong, China. He spends the first twelve years of his life there. 
                    During his childhood, he lived with his mother and his mother's side grandparents. 
                    He spends most of his time like most other children there - going to school, studying, 
                    and hanging out with friends.<br /><br /> When he was twelve years old, he moved to San Jose, California 
                    with his father, living there until this day. The first few years of his life in San Jose were 
                    a little difficult. He doesn't know any friends there, can't speak English very well, and had a 
                    hard time fitting in school. But the teachers and classmates he met were nice, they helped him a 
                    lot when he was in school. By the time Jun get to High school, he was already used to life in California.
